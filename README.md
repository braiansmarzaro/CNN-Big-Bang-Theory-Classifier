# CNN Big Bang Theory Classifier
 
The Convolutional Neural Network aims to classify the face images of 4 different characters using Keras and a topology learned at Nvidea's Introduction to Deep Learning Course

In this Project we can see that the dataset is not good enough to do with a CNN because it can't get an generalization trought about 400 images, where more than 40% are from one class.
This project applied Importing, Labelling Data, Data Visualization, Data Normalization, Data Augmentation, Keras Model, Keras Early Stop CallBack, Model Saving and Prediction.
